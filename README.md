# Online-Dmeo
This demo is to showcase the intended functionality of the Fuudy interactive storage network that allow each individual fridge to open based on facial recognition  algorithm. And multiple fridges shall interact with each other as a hive collection that the food inside will be managed accordingly.

The intended use has two implications:
  1). to showcase the capability of the single fridge using facial recognition/facial ID system, embedded AI to track food storage
  2). to show the potential of the multi-fridge scenario where multiple fridges exchange data and simutaneously calculate the food demand based on sensor data
  
  The demo will spread out to 2 parts: 
   1). the single fridge scenario
   2). the multi-fridge scenario
